# A simple CPU-GPU AMG framework by Xiaotian Tian
We have developed an AMG framework for CPU-GPU heterogeneous environment. The current framework has been basically completed, but it still needs to be improved. We are optimizing it.


If you want to use our framework, just compile and run it in the following ways:


##1.How to make

sh Makefile.sh


##2.How to use


./amg matrix.mtx


(Note: you need to change the value of SM and CUDA path according to the GPU you are using)


At present, our work is only for academic research.
